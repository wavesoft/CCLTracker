The aim of this article is to analyse the effectiveness of entries (visit behaviour and length of sessions) depending on their traffic source: direct visit, in-link entries (for instance, en.wikipedia.org), and search engine visits (for example, Google). For this purpose, time series analysis of Google Analytics data is made use of. This method could be interesting for any tourism website optimizer. "

	Annote = {Google Analytics is a free web analytics solution that provides webmasters with insightful information about how visitors find and interact with their websites. In this case study, we have experimented in using Google Analytics to analyze two of our websites: The Rutgers-Newark Law Library main website and The New Jersey Digital Legal Library website. It was used to monitor our visitors' browsing activities and viewing behaviors for three months. Based on our findings from Google Analytics reports, we have redesigned our website. Subsequent data collected by Google Analytics have confirmed that our new design better fits the information needs of our visitors and librarians. Google Analytics is very powerful and can be used for almost any website. We believe that other libraries will benefit from using Google Analytics as well. Limitations of Google Analytics are also discussed based on our experience with it.},

    abstract = { Purpose – The aim of this paper is to develop a new user‐friendly in‐house tracking methodology for academics to analyse the effectiveness of visits (return visit behaviour and length of sessions) depending on their traffic source: direct visits, referring site entries and search engine visits. In other words, how deep do visitors navigate into the web site? Which is their internal performance depending on their traffic source?Design/methodology/approach – This paper addresses these questions by time series analysis of Google Analytics data. Some statistical matters with regard to the use of Google Analytics data in combination with time series methodology are fine‐tuned.Findings – Return visits are the main engine for nurturing session length, but which type of traffic source nurtures these return visits? In order to answer this question, an important distinction must be made between “total return visits” and “marginal return visits”. Site entries stay longer to the extent their “marginal return effectiveness” is higher. For our particular web site direct visits are the most effective ones, followed by search engine visits and only thirdly link‐entries.Research limitations/implications – This methodology is critical for an effective web site traffic source monitoring and benchmarking that may lead to better web site strategies.Originality/value – The importance of this paper is not the particular web site but the new methodology tested to arrive at these results, an experiment that could be repeated with different web sites. }
